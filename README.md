# Sudoku Python GUI App

Python-based project that showcases a Sudoku solver powered by the efficient backtracking algorithm. 
Sudoku is a timeless logic-based number puzzle that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits according to specific rules. The primary objective is to ensure each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9.



The Sudoku solver leverages the power of the backtracking algorithm, enabling it to methodically explore potential solutions while making informed choices at every step. This algorithmic approach, combined with a recursive strategy, allows the solver to intelligently test different values in each cell while upholding the integrity of the solution.

This application offers both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a text-based version.

#### Features
Efficient Backtracking Algorithm: Our solver employs a carefully crafted backtracking algorithm that navigates through possibilities with precision, ensuring a reliable and accurate solution.

Recursive Strategy: The use of recursion is a key component of our algorithm. It enables the solver to explore various value combinations systematically, leading to a satisfying solution.

#### How to Use
-Run GUI.py: Executing the GUI.py file will launch the application's graphical user interface.
-Click on a cell to select it.
-Enter a number on your keyboard to pencil in a candidate.
-Confirm your choice by pressing the ENTER key for the selected cell.
-To remove a candidate, simply click the DEL key.

-When you're ready to watch the algorithm work its magic, hit the SPACE key to initiate the solving process. Sit back and enjoy the unfolding solution.
