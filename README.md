# Sudoku Solver

This project showcases a Sudoku solver implemented in Python, utilizing the powerful backtracking algorithm. 
Sudoku is a classic logic-based number puzzle that requires filling a 9x9 grid with digits while following specific rules.

#### Features
-Efficient Backtracking Algorithm: The solver employs a backtracking algorithm to systematically explore possible solutions, making intelligent decisions at each step.
-Recursive Strategy: Utilizing recursion, the algorithm iteratively attempts different values in each cell while maintaining the validity of the solution.
